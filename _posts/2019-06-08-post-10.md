## Venture Capitalists cannot afford to miss the esports wave.

I recently finished Scott Kupor’s The Secrets of Sandhill Road (highly recommended, you can find it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Sand-Hill-Road-Venture/dp/059308358X" target="_blank">here</a>). There is a ton of good information in the book, but the two parts I want to talk about are what he calls the power-law curve and the VC investment criteria.

The power law curve looks like this:

The basic theory behind the power law curve is successful VCs don’t make their money off of a series of good returns, they make their money off a few exceptionally great ones. Scott describes the most important characteristic to measure a VC is the ‘number of bats per home run’. That is, how many investments until they find one that is a 10x or higher. 

In order to find the next home run, they look for three categories: people, product, and market. Because I'm talking about an industry rather than a specific company, we can only look at market.

## Total Addressable Market

Finding the total addressable market for a nascent industry is more than looking for the closest comparable and applying multiples. It takes some imagination.

Some may use traditional sports or video as a proxy for the market size of esports. Superficially, it makes sense. Like esports, traditional sports have professional players competing for prizes and championships. Viewership is split between in-person experiences and online streaming/television, with the online portion making up the majority of viewers. 

Video encompasses prepared and live content consumed on a screen. The screen can be a TV, computer, or phone. The advent of streaming makes it possible to consume content on demand (ala Netflix) or live (ESPN) anywhere and anytime. 

What we think of as traditional video games and traditional sports are slowly merging via video (streaming etc). Esports will also eat into Netflix’s market share, so I believe the true addressable market is a combination of the sports and video markets. Esports will compete in the broader market for attention.

## The Market For Attention

Esports is a tech disruption for entertainment like Netflix was for video. In fact, I believe that esports is disrupting the entire video category as well. In a world of abundance, the most valuable finite resource is attention. 

Facebook competes for your attention with Youtube, and each app on your phone fights for your time and attention. For a while, video games competed with television in completely separate categories. You either turned on the television or you turned on your console/PC. With the advent of esports and streaming, this dichotomy is changing. 

Until recently, video games could only be consumed actively (I define active as an activity where your participation changes the outcome of the event, I explain more in an article here). Because video games can be consumed passively the act of turning on a TV no longer precludes people from consuming video games.
