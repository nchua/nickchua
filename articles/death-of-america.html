                    <p>Trump's presidency is indicative of a nation-threatening division rather than its root cause. I believe contemporary America sits at the most precarious moment in the nation's history since the Civil War.</p>

                    <h2>Learning from History</h2>
                    <p>This piece draws inspiration from Jared Diamond's work <em>Upheaval</em>, which analyzes seven countries that experienced severe crises. The framework examines how nations respond to existential challenges—and what separates those that survive from those that fracture.</p>
                    <blockquote>Nations, like individuals, face moments of crisis that reveal their fundamental character.</blockquote>
                    <p>Two cases are particularly instructive: Chile under Pinochet and Indonesia under Suharto. Both experienced profound political upheaval. Both had their trajectories shaped by how different factions responded to crisis.</p>

                    <h2>The Division We Face</h2>
                    <p>American political polarization has reached levels that make productive governance nearly impossible. We've sorted ourselves geographically, informationally, and socially. Democrats and Republicans increasingly live in different worlds with different facts.</p>
                    <p>This isn't about policy disagreements—healthy democracies have those. This is about fundamental incompatibility in how different Americans understand reality itself.</p>

                    <h2>Money Talks</h2>
                    <p>Economic inequality exacerbates political division. When different economic classes have radically different experiences of the economy, they naturally develop radically different political preferences. The wealthy live in one America; the working class lives in another.</p>
                    <p>Historical precedent suggests this combination—political polarization plus economic stratification—creates conditions ripe for democratic breakdown.</p>

                    <h2>The Path Forward</h2>
                    <p>The nations that survive crises are those that can honestly assess their situation, take responsibility for problems rather than assigning blame, and make selective changes while preserving core values.</p>
                    <p>Whether America can do this remains an open question. The answer will define the next generation of American history.</p>
