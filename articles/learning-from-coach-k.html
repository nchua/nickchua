                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>I recently had the opportunity to hear Coach Mike Krzyzewski speak at a Citadel event about leadership, team culture, and what it takes to build winning organizations. Coach K has won five NCAA championships at Duke, led Team USA to three Olympic gold medals, and is widely considered one of the greatest basketball coaches of all time. Here are the seven key takeaways from his talk.</p>

                    <h2>1. Standards Over Rules</h2>

                    <p>Coach K opened with a distinction that fundamentally changed how I think about leadership: the difference between rules and standards.</p>

                    <p>Rules tell people what they can't do. They're reactive, punitive, and create an adversarial relationship between leaders and teams. When you have rules, people naturally look for loopholes. They ask "what can I get away with?" rather than "what should I do?"</p>

                    <p>Standards, by contrast, tell people who they are. They're aspirational, positive, and create shared ownership. When you set high standards and live by them, the team polices itself. No one wants to be the person who lets the standard slip because the standard defines their identity.</p>

                    <blockquote>Rules tell you what you can't do. Standards tell you who you are. When you violate a rule, you're just breaking a rule. When you fail to meet a standard, you're failing yourself and everyone who shares that standard with you.</blockquote>

                    <p>At Duke, there's no rule that says "be on time." There's a standard that Duke basketball players respect each other's time. The outcome is the same—players show up on time—but the mindset is completely different. One creates compliance, the other creates culture.</p>

                    <h2>2. The Seven Core Values</h2>

                    <p>Coach K shared the seven core values that guide Duke basketball. These aren't posted on a wall and forgotten—they're lived principles that inform every decision:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Respect</strong> — For teammates, opponents, the game, and yourself. Respect is the foundation everything else builds on.</li>
                        <li><strong>Honesty</strong> — With yourself and with others. Honest communication prevents small problems from becoming big ones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Confidence</strong> — Belief in yourself and your preparation. Confidence isn't arrogance; it's earned through work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Collective Responsibility</strong> — No one succeeds alone. When someone fails, the team shares that failure. When someone succeeds, the team shares that success.</li>
                        <li><strong>Communication</strong> — Clear, constant, and caring. The best teams over-communicate rather than under-communicate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trust</strong> — In your teammates' intentions and abilities. Trust is earned over time and lost in an instant.</li>
                        <li><strong>Care</strong> — Genuine concern for each other's wellbeing, on and off the court. When people know you care about them as humans, not just as players, they'll run through walls for you.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>What struck me was how these values interconnect. You can't have trust without honesty. You can't have collective responsibility without care. They form a system, not a checklist.</p>

                    <h2>3. Not Getting Up for Big Games</h2>

                    <p>Coach K shared a story that reframes how we think about big moments. Early in his career, before a huge game against Navy, his players were buzzing with nervous energy. They kept talking about how important the game was, how much it meant, how they needed to "get up" for this one.</p>

                    <p>He pulled them together and asked: "Do you get up for big games?"</p>

                    <p>They nodded enthusiastically. Of course they did.</p>

                    <p>"Then what does that mean about all the other games? Are those not worth getting up for?"</p>

                    <p>The room went silent.</p>

                    <blockquote>If you only bring your best for 'big' games, you're admitting you don't bring your best for every game. Excellence isn't a switch you flip on for important moments. It's a habit you build through consistent effort.</blockquote>

                    <p>From that moment on, Duke basketball had a new standard: every game gets the same preparation. Every practice gets the same intensity. You don't rise to the occasion—you fall to the level of your training. The Navy game became just another game, which meant it received the same excellent preparation as every other game.</p>

                    <p>They won.</p>

                    <h2>4. Seeking Excellence, Not Perfection</h2>

                    <p>Perfection is a trap. It's unattainable, and the pursuit of it often paralyzes people into inaction. Coach K emphasized that he doesn't want perfect players—he wants excellent ones.</p>

                    <p>Excellence means doing your best with what you have in the current moment. It acknowledges that you'll make mistakes, that conditions are never ideal, that opponents are actively trying to stop you. Excellence is adaptable. Perfection is brittle.</p>

                    <p>When a player makes a mistake in practice, Coach K doesn't berate them for failing to be perfect. He asks: "Was that your best?" If the answer is yes, they move on and try to improve. If the answer is no, that's the real problem—not the mistake itself, but the lack of full effort.</p>

                    <p>This distinction liberated his players. They stopped fearing failure and started focusing on effort. Paradoxically, this led to better outcomes because players were willing to take risks and push their limits rather than playing safe to avoid mistakes.</p>

                    <h2>5. Changing Communication Style</h2>

                    <p>One of the most surprising parts of Coach K's talk was his admission that he's had to completely change how he communicates. What worked with players in the 1980s doesn't work with players today—and that's not a criticism of today's players.</p>

                    <p>He talked about learning to text recruits because that's how young people communicate. At first, it felt foreign and inefficient. But he realized that meeting people where they are is a form of respect. If a recruit feels more comfortable texting, then texting is the right communication channel.</p>

                    <p>He mentioned his sneaker collection with a laugh. Apparently, knowing about sneaker culture helps him connect with recruits and current players. It's not about pretending to be young—it's about showing genuine interest in what matters to the people you're leading.</p>

                    <blockquote>Different people need different approaches. A great leader learns how each team member receives information and adjusts accordingly. What motivates one person might demoralize another.</blockquote>

                    <p>The underlying principle is adaptive communication. Some players respond to direct criticism. Others need encouragement first. Some want public recognition. Others prefer private acknowledgment. Coach K invests time in understanding each player's communication preferences and adapts his style accordingly.</p>

                    <h2>6. Thoughts on Retirement</h2>

                    <p>When asked about retirement, Coach K was reflective. He admitted that he's thought about it—you don't coach for forty-plus years without contemplating the end—but he's not ready yet.</p>

                    <p>What keeps him going isn't the wins or the championships. It's the relationships. Every year brings a new team, new personalities, new challenges. The freshness of each season renews his energy. He loves the process of taking a group of individuals and forging them into a team.</p>

                    <p>He also mentioned the fear that many coaches have: that their identity is too wrapped up in coaching. When you've done something for so long, who are you without it? Coach K seemed at peace with this question—he has family, interests outside basketball, and a life beyond the court—but he acknowledged it's something every long-tenured leader must grapple with.</p>

                    <p>The message I took away: love what you do, but maintain an identity beyond it. The work is important, but it's not everything.</p>

                    <h2>7. Tidbits About MJ, Kobe, and Kawhi</h2>

                    <p>Coaching Team USA gave Coach K access to the greatest basketball players in the world. He shared a few stories that illuminated what separates good players from legends.</p>

                    <p><strong>Michael Jordan:</strong> The competitive intensity is real and unmatched. Everything is a competition with MJ—cards, golf, shooting drills. Coach K described watching Jordan turn a casual pregame shootaround into a personal battle with himself. He wasn't competing against teammates; he was competing against his own previous best. That internal standard drove everything.</p>

                    <p><strong>Kobe Bryant:</strong> The work ethic stories are not exaggerated. Coach K confirmed that Kobe would schedule extra training sessions at hours when no one else was awake. But what struck him most was Kobe's curiosity. He asked questions constantly—about strategy, about opponents, about basketball history. He wanted to understand the game at a level beyond just playing it.</p>

                    <p><strong>Kawhi Leonard:</strong> The quietest superstar Coach K has worked with, but the silence is purposeful. Kawhi communicates through action. He doesn't need to talk because his play does the talking. Coach K described Kawhi's preparation as meticulous—he studies opponents obsessively and executes game plans precisely. The lack of flash masks a deeply analytical basketball mind.</p>

                    <p>The common thread among all three: an internal standard of excellence that exceeds any external expectation. They don't need coaches to push them because they push themselves harder than anyone else could.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                    <p>Listening to Coach K reminded me that leadership principles transcend domains. Whether you're coaching basketball, running a company, or managing a small team, the fundamentals are the same: set high standards, communicate clearly, adapt to your people, and care about them as humans first.</p>

                    <p>The most memorable line from the entire talk came during Q&A. Someone asked what advice he'd give to young leaders.</p>

                    <p>Coach K paused, then said: "Culture isn't what you say. It's what you tolerate."</p>

                    <p>That's stuck with me ever since. Every time I see a standard slip and say nothing, I'm defining the culture. Every time I address it, I'm defining the culture. Leadership isn't about grand speeches—it's about small moments of choosing to uphold or abandon your standards.</p>

                    <blockquote>You don't build a championship program through one big decision. You build it through thousands of small decisions to maintain your standards when it would be easier to let them slide.</blockquote>
