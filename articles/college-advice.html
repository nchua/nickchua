                    <p>College experiences vary widely and are shaped by individual choices, circumstances, and sheer luck. I don't claim to have figured everything out, but looking back on my own experience, there are patterns that helped and pitfalls I wish I'd avoided. Here are nine practical tips that made a difference for me—your mileage may vary.</p>

                    <h2>1. Join Organizations Early</h2>

                    <p>Don't wait until sophomore year to find your people. The organizations you join freshman year often become your core social group for the rest of college. This isn't just about networking or resume building—it's about mental health.</p>

                    <p>Building community improves mental wellness, which supports academic success. It's a virtuous cycle: when you have friends you see regularly, you're happier; when you're happier, you perform better academically; when you perform better academically, you have more bandwidth for relationships.</p>

                    <p>The first few weeks of freshman year are uniquely suited for joining organizations. Everyone is new, everyone is looking for connections, and the social barriers are lower than they'll ever be again. Take advantage of this window. Go to the activities fair. Sign up for things that seem even mildly interesting. You can always drop out later—you can't always join later.</p>

                    <p>The specific organizations matter less than the act of joining. Whether it's intramural sports, a cappella, debate, cultural clubs, professional societies, or something else entirely, the structure provides regular touchpoints with the same people. Repeated interaction is the foundation of friendship.</p>

                    <h2>2. Befriend Older Students</h2>

                    <p>Cultivate friendships with students who are ahead of you. This seems obvious but many freshmen naturally cluster with other freshmen. Expanding your circle vertically provides enormous benefits.</p>

                    <p>Upperclassmen have done what you're about to do. They've taken the classes you're considering, navigated the bureaucracy you'll encounter, and made the mistakes you haven't made yet. Their hindsight becomes your foresight. A junior can tell you which professor to avoid, which extracurricular is a time sink, which internship application process matters most.</p>

                    <p>Beyond practical advice, older students provide perspective. When you're stressed about a midterm, they can remind you that they felt the same way and survived. When you're anxious about recruiting, they can share what actually mattered and what didn't. This perspective is invaluable for maintaining sanity.</p>

                    <p>The easiest way to meet upperclassmen is through organizations (see tip #1). When you join a club, you're automatically placed in contact with students from all years. Make an effort to know them beyond the context of the organization itself.</p>

                    <h2>3. Research Professors Before Registering</h2>

                    <p>Rate My Professor exists for a reason. Use it. The same course with different professors can be a completely different experience—different workload, different grading, different teaching style, different engagement.</p>

                    <p>When registering for classes, most students optimize for subject matter and timing. Few optimize for instructor quality. This is a mistake. A great professor can make a boring subject fascinating. A terrible professor can make a fascinating subject miserable.</p>

                    <p>Look for patterns in reviews rather than outliers. One disgruntled student doesn't mean much. Ten students consistently praising or criticizing the same traits is meaningful. Pay attention to comments about accessibility, clarity of expectations, and fairness of grading.</p>

                    <p>Also: don't avoid challenging professors entirely. Some of my most valuable classes were demanding ones that pushed me. The goal isn't to optimize for easiness—it's to optimize for quality of learning experience. Sometimes that means a harder professor who actually teaches you something.</p>

                    <h2>4. Attend Class Intentionally</h2>

                    <p>Going to class is table stakes. What matters is how you show up.</p>

                    <p>Sit in the front third of the room. Not because professors will notice (though they might), but because it changes your own engagement. When you're in front, distractions are behind you. You naturally pay more attention. Your body language signals to your brain that this matters.</p>

                    <p>Ask questions without fear of judgment. The students who ask "dumb questions" often learn more than those protecting their ego. Every question you're afraid to ask, three other people are wondering the same thing. Be the one who speaks up.</p>

                    <p>Participate in discussions. In seminars and smaller classes, participation is often a significant portion of your grade. But even where it isn't, engaging verbally helps cement concepts in your memory and demonstrates investment to the professor.</p>

                    <blockquote>Curiosity drives learning. The students who treat class as a checkbox miss the point. The students who treat it as an opportunity get more out of every hour.</blockquote>

                    <h2>5. Use Office Hours Strategically</h2>

                    <p>Office hours are the most underutilized resource in college. Most professors hold them, few students attend, and the ones who do gain disproportionate advantages.</p>

                    <p>In humanities courses, professor perspectives significantly influence grading. Understanding how your professor thinks about the material—what they find interesting, what frameworks they use, what arguments they find compelling—helps you write papers they'll respond to positively. Office hours give you direct access to this information.</p>

                    <p>When struggling academically, office hours transform your relationship from adversarial to collaborative. Professors want students to succeed. When you show up asking for help, you're signaling that you care about improving. This changes how they perceive you and often how they grade borderline work.</p>

                    <p>Preparation matters. Don't show up with nothing to discuss. Bring specific questions, concepts you're confused about, or ideas you want to explore. Professors appreciate students who've done the reading and thought about the material before seeking help.</p>

                    <p>Professors remember students who show up. When it's time for recommendations, research opportunities, or career advice, you'll be a person rather than a name on a roster.</p>

                    <h2>6. Study in Groups</h2>

                    <p>Solo studying has its place, but collaborative studying provides benefits that solitary work cannot.</p>

                    <p>Teaching concepts to others forces you to understand them deeply. When you explain a theory to a study partner, gaps in your understanding become immediately apparent. You can't bullshit your way through an explanation to a peer the way you can to yourself.</p>

                    <p>Problem-solving together generates approaches you wouldn't discover alone. When you're stuck, a fresh perspective can unlock the solution. When your study partner is stuck, explaining your approach reinforces your own understanding.</p>

                    <p>Some of my best college friendships started in study groups. There's something bonding about shared struggle. The late nights before exams, the collective frustration at a difficult problem set, the celebration when something finally clicks—these experiences create connections.</p>

                    <p>Find study partners who match your level of commitment. Too serious and you'll feel pressured; too casual and you'll get distracted. The goal is productive struggle together.</p>

                    <h2>7. Be Generous Helping Others</h2>

                    <p>Help classmates without expecting repayment. Share your notes. Explain concepts. Forward opportunities. Creating a culture of mutual assistance benefits everyone, including you.</p>

                    <p>This isn't naive idealism—it's strategic generosity. When you help freely, people remember. When you need help later, they're inclined to reciprocate. The person you tutored in sophomore year might be the one who refers you for a job in senior year.</p>

                    <p>Beyond self-interest: teaching is learning. Every time you explain something to someone else, you understand it better yourself. The time you "lose" helping a classmate is actually invested in deepening your own knowledge.</p>

                    <p>What goes around comes around. The students who hoard information and compete ruthlessly might win individual battles, but they create enemies. The students who share freely and help generously build networks that pay dividends for years.</p>

                    <h2>8. Ask for Things</h2>

                    <p>Advocate for yourself. Ask administrators and instructors about exceptions or accommodations. Ask professors for research positions. Ask alumni for coffee chats. Ask upperclassmen for advice.</p>

                    <p>The worst they can say is no.</p>

                    <p>Many opportunities exist for those who ask that others never discover. Extensions, grade adjustments, special programs, funding, introductions—these things don't appear automatically. Someone has to request them.</p>

                    <blockquote>The worst they can say is no. But if you don't ask, the answer is already no by default. Asking costs almost nothing and occasionally yields enormous returns.</blockquote>

                    <p>Most people dramatically underestimate the willingness of others to help. Professors enjoy mentoring interested students. Alumni like advising people from their alma mater. Administrators have more flexibility than they initially indicate. But they're not going to volunteer these things—you have to ask.</p>

                    <p>Yes, you'll face rejection. That's fine. Rejection costs nothing. The occasional yes more than compensates for many nos.</p>

                    <h2>9. Balance Structure and Spontaneity</h2>

                    <p>Oscar Wilde wrote: "Everything in moderation, including moderation." This is my favorite piece of life advice and perfectly captures the college tension between discipline and adventure.</p>

                    <p>Maintain enough structure to succeed academically and professionally. Go to class, meet deadlines, prepare for interviews, build skills. These fundamentals matter and cannot be neglected without consequence.</p>

                    <p>But leave room for memorable experiences. Some of my best college memories came from spontaneous decisions—road trips, late-night conversations, random events I almost skipped. The most memorable moments often stem from stepping outside rigid routines.</p>

                    <p>The danger is extremes. Pure structure produces a joyless grind that burns you out. Pure spontaneity produces chaos that tanks your grades and opportunities. The art is finding a sustainable balance where discipline enables adventure and adventure refreshes discipline.</p>

                    <p>Senior year, you won't remember most of your problem sets or readings. You'll remember the people, the experiences, the times you said yes to something unexpected. Don't be so focused on optimization that you forget to live.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                    <p>College is short. Four years sounds like a long time until it's over, and then you wonder where it went. The advice above is my attempt to share what I learned, but your experience will be different.</p>

                    <p>The overarching theme: be intentional. Don't drift through college on autopilot. Make deliberate choices about how you spend your time, who you spend it with, and what you're optimizing for. The students who reflect on their experience and adjust course outperform those who simply follow the default path.</p>

                    <p>Good luck.</p>
