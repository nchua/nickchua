### Request for Companies:

This has been a list that I’ve wanted to create for a while. Basically, I want it to be a running list of ideas for products/companies just in case someone who is working on one of them is reading my website. I’ve divided up the ideas into three sections – realistic, unlikely, and kooky. 

### Realistic:

[Wrist-attached keyboard:](/rfc1){:target="_blank"} A flexible, light-weight keyboard attached to each wrist so you don't need to look at your phone while walking, or type with just your thumbs while sitting. 

Cooking App: Enter all the ingredients you have in your house, and it gives you potential recipes to make. Great for using up leftover ingredients and allows the user to try new recipes. Bonus points if you're able to rank each recipe and it learns your preferences over time. How to make it social - people can add their own recipes to the app, get ranked based on how much other people like the recipes, and earn bonus points for quality of recipe (if you added pictures etc).


### Unlikely:

[A bet-based bar:](/rfc2){:target="_blank"} This is a completely reimagined version of an experience at a bar/club. Instead of a normal cover, people pay one fifth (1/5) of their Amazon wish list for the night. If your Amazon wish list totals to $500, you'd pay a $100 cover.


### Kooky:

Moving Sidewalks: This idea needs to be fleshed out a bit more, but the basic premise of the idea is that everyone prefers the moving walkways within airports, so why not expand that beyond airports? Start with malls and then move to other high-traffic, large enclosed spaces. Eventually, everything could be a walking sidewalk and people could purchase their own individual tiles to stand on.
