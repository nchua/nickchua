        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I am a 23 year old Bay Area native living in Chicago, IL. In my previous life I played varsity tennis at the University of Chicago - you can find my record <a href="https://athletics.uchicago.edu/sports/mten/2017-18/bios/chua_nicolas_49g3?view=bio" target="_blank">here</a>. I currently work as an analyst at Inoca Capital Partners and am primarily interested in how technology causes paradigm shifts in social norms. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned a lot in my time at UChicago. If you are still in college or about to attend college and want to hear my advice for doing well in college click <a href="cadvice">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <h3>Books</h3>
        <p>
          I am an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy. My favorite authors include: Patrick Rothfuss, Brent Weeks, R.A. Salvatore, and Steven Erikson. My past and present favorite series are The Kingkiller Chronicles, Night Angel Trilogy, and Eragon. I am also a fan of Star Wars novelizations, but refuse to read any material covering the new trilogy. If you know of any series that fit a similar profile I would love to know!
        </p>
        <p>
          For non-casual reading, I typically enjoy autobiographies of people I admire or books that imagines new use cases for recent research. Some favorites of mine include Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad Poor Dad, Pete Sampras' A Champion's Mind, and Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow. I am currently reading Youngme Moon's Different: Escaping the Competitive Herd.
        </p>

        <h3>Wearable Technology</h3>
        <p>
          Advances in wearable technology fascinates me as we become ever more connected to our online presences. I am currently following and waiting to purchase the Focals by North and the Levi's Commuter X Jacquard by Google once their prohibitive prices decline. 
        </p>

        <h3>E-Sports</h3>
        <p>
          I believe that one day e-sports will become the norm rather than the <i>other</i>. Not everyone is born with the natural gifts of Lebron James, nor can everyone  afford expensive treatments such as the ones Lionel Messi received. However, to a certain extent, everyone can identify with the gifts of a professional gamer. I believe that as the social stigma of video games declines and health concerns over contact sports increase, e-sports will rise in popularity and become normalized. This can be seen already in countries such as South Korea, and to a certain extent the United States. Large traditional sports franchises such as the Golden State Warrios, Houston Rockets, and the Cleveland Cavaliers have invested with conglomerates such as The Walt Disney Company in League of Legends teams. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I firmly believe that this change will come within my lifetime. The NBA Finals in 2016 was watched by a record-breaking number of viewers, as Lebron James led the Cleveland Cavaliers over the dominant 73 win Warrios. But if Riot Games (creators of League of Legends) is to be believed, even more people watched the League of Legends World Championship Finals than the <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/06/more-people-watched-league-of-legends-than-the-nba-finals/">NBA Finals </a>. The acceptance of E-sports will be gradual, but will fundamentally change the social landscape. I believe this will have large economic ramifications as E-sports will act as a disruptor of traditional sports rather than parallel competitor. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently following the League of Legends scene. When I publish articles or thoughts on the scene, you will be able to find them on this webpage.
        </p>

        <h3>Food</h3>
        <p>
          My favorite foods in descending order are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup</li>
          <li>Ramen</li>
          <li>Tuna Poke</li>
          <li>Carne Asada Burrito</li>
          <li>Lamb Vindaloo</li>
          <li>Tiramisu</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I've also made it my goal to review every ramen shop in the Chicago area, you can find my blog <a href="https://nickchua14.wixsite.com/ramen4lyfe">here</a>. If you have any recommendations in Chicago or the Bay Area, please send them to me.
        </p>

        <h3>Movies</h3>
        <p>
          My favorite movies often embody similar traits of my favorite books - an immersive world that lives within the science fiction / fantasy genre. Here is a list of my favorite movie(s)/series and a quick description why.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Lord of the Rings</b> - The extended versions of Peter Jackson's original trilogy create a wonderfully complex and rewarding version of Middle Earth. The sheer scale of the battles and plot has always amazed me, and the CGI still stands up to today's standards. This to me is a perfect trilogy and the Men bowing to the Hobbits in the end still warms my heart. </li>
          <li><b>Star Wars</b> - No series excited me more when I was younger than Star Wars. I dressed a Jedi for three years in a row for Halloween, and the idea of using the Force permeated many of my dreams. I vehemently defend that the Prequels are not as bad as everyone remembers, and believe that the Clone Wars series adds a great amount of depth to Episodes 2 and 3. I think Star Wars does a better job than any other in developing its expanded universe in a way that makes sense and adds value (looking a you, Pottermore). Rogue One and Solo do a commendable job of this as well, but I completely disavow any of the new trilogy. Luke Skywalker turning rogue, Leia using the force for the first time while unconscious, and the addition of light-speed weapons undermines the very premise of the Star Wars universe in my opinion. I would welcome any arguments to the contrary at nick@nickchua.me</li>
          <li><b>Marvel Universe</b> - I know this isn't a specific movie or series, but I admire how so many movies have built up in one congruent universe. I think the Russo brothers did an amazing job keeping the story unique and unexpected in Infinity War and cannot wait for what they have in store for Endgame. I'm also a big fan of the Toby Macguire and Andrew Garfield versions of Spider-man. Maybe I just want to have super powers. Sue me.</li>
        </ul>
