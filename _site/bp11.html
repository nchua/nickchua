<!--         <h2>How To Remove Like Counters</h2> -->
        <h4 id="for-the-past-few-months-instagram-has-experimented-with-removing-public-like-counters-in-various-countries-last-week-instagram-ceo-adam-mosseri-announced-that-the-tests-will-be-moving-to-the-united-states--the-final-sign-that-instagram-may-be-leaning-towards-making-this-change-for-good-ive-previously-written--that-facebook-ought-to-remove-the-public-counter-for-the-good-of-the-platform-but-i-think-they-are-implementing-this-change-incorrectly">For the past few months, Instagram has experimented with removing public like counters in various countries. Last week, Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri announced that the tests will be moving to the United States – the final sign that Instagram may be leaning towards making this change for good. I’ve <a href="https://nickchua.me/bp9" target="_blank">previously written </a> that Facebook ought to remove the public counter for the good of the platform, but I think they are implementing this change incorrectly.</h4>

<p>There are two types of users on Instagram – personal users and brands/influencers. While Facebook and Instagram’s growth historically has been in the personal category, the second has grown as the market for new organic users saturated. And even though both type of users use the exact same platform, their goals and incentives are quite different. Personal users engage with their friends and consume influencer/brand content, while influencers and brands create content to make money.</p>

<p>Since both user types have different goals, Facebook has to consider the externalities of any change they make. I believe that removing the public like counter is a good thing for personal users. Over time, people have realized that post engagement can be used as a proxy for social status. Therefore, we have learned to optimize our posts in order to maintain appearances. In my opinion, this has reduced peer-to-peer engagement on the platform and has reduced the intangible ‘fun’ feeling of them.</p>

<p>For Facebook, this result runs exactly counter to their mission statement: to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.</p>

<p>Removing the like counter makes sense for the personal user. For the influencer, however, removing the like counter is not a good thing. Your follower count and engagement (like/follower ratio and/or your comment/like ratio) as an influencer are extremely important to generate brand interest. I have a few friends who are influencers on Instagram, and I’m not aware of any other metric used by brands for their investment decision. If the public like counter disappears, brands will be forced to turn to Instagram to source influencers for campaigns. This hurts the long-term influencer ecosystem as it becomes almost impossible to organically grow.</p>

<p>There are three possible reasons why Facebook would hurt the influencers on Instagram: Facebook doesn’t know that they are hurting influencers, they know they will hurt them but have judged the pros of the change to outweigh the cons, or Facebook is deliberately hurting the influencer market.</p>

<p>While it’s tempting to ascribe their move to Hanlon’s razor, Facebook is too shrewd to completely miss the implications. So I don’t believe it’s option one. Adam Mosseri has publicly taken the stance that it’s the second option when he said, “We will make decisions that hurt the business if they help people’s well-being and health.” (add citation). But sacrificing profits has not been Facebook’s M.O. over the past few years, so we’re left with option three.</p>

<p>Why would Facebook deliberately hurt the growing portion of their platform? <a href="https://www.katherinewu.me/writings/why-is-instagram-removing-likes" target="_blank">Katherine Wu</a> wrote a really interesting piece detailing why Instagram could actually be removing likes to increase revenue instead of protecting users. Essentially, influencers have created their own businesses on Instagram and are generating revenue from sponsorships. The problem for Instagram is that while they provide the platform, they don’t share in any of this revenue. This is a no-go for Facebook and they are taking steps to remedy it.</p>

<p>Removing public like counters also removes the engagement signals that brands use to pick their influencers. It also will most likely <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/new-report-examines-the-impact-of-instagrams-hidden-likes-experiment-on-in/566887/" target="_blank">decrease their engagement.</a></p>

<p><img src="/pictures/posts/bp11/instagramv2p1.png" alt="" class="img-container-center" /></p>

<p>Because of this, Katherine suggests that brands will be forced to turn to Instagram to place ads either with effective influencers or through ad placements. This way, Instagram gets their share of the revenue. The problem is this only works if Instagram owns people’s followers, and can decide who gets to have the engagement. And on the surface level they do. Instagram controls the feed algorithm and they control ad placements, but I don’t believe they own a person’s following.</p>

<p>The most successful influencers online create personas that extend beyond any one platform. This becomes obvious when we look at more established creator  platforms like YouTube, Twitch, etc. Fortnite star streamer Ninja reportedly made $10 million a year streaming on Twitch, but he was recently paid an undisclosed amount by Microsoft’s streaming service Mixer to switch platforms. There are no official details on the amount paid, but other streamers have estimated his contract was worth anywhere from $25 to $100 million.</p>

<p>While Ninja’s personal value is unusual, his follower behavior is not. He continues to break records on Mixer because his followers have made the shift with him. Fans communicate with creators through in-platform chat programs, donations, and social media. Because of this, streamers are able to create a sense of community that follows them from the streaming platform to other forms of social media.</p>

<p>Microsoft and other brands have realized this and instead of attempting to wrest power from the creator, they lean into it. Instagram should be creating reasons for creators to stay instead of giving them reasons to leave. How do they do that? Influencers are on the platform to make money, help them make more money.</p>

<p>There are a few cut and dry solutions that already exist. Super apps like WeChat in China allow for users to buy merchandise in-app. Users can live-stream releases of new products and viewers can buy the advertised item within five taps in-app. I’m really surprised this isn’t an avenue that Facebook isn’t exploring more aggressively with their recent announcement of Facebook pay and their focus on Libra.</p>

<p>If Instagram built this out they could charge a small service fee on every transaction. It’s understandable that they want a cut of the revenue generated on the platform, but this way they would put the burden on the consumer instead of the creator. This gives influencers a reason to double down on the platform. This is by no means the best or only option, but taking away like counters is definitely not the only way Facebook can monetize influencer followings.</p>

<p>Thus we return to the original three considerations. Does Facebook know they are going to harm influencers? Are influencers the collateral damage necessary to improve the platform? Or are they being deliberately harmed? I believe Facebook can generate additional revenue and protect users at the same time. They just need to change how they’re implementing the removal of like counters.</p>

<p>Just like in my original article, I propose that Facebook distinguish between two different types of accounts – public and private. Accounts are private by default, but can apply to become public in a similar process to verified accounts today. Private accounts will no longer have the like counter, but public accounts will.</p>

<p>This does centralize a lot of the power as Facebook gets to decide who is an influencer and who isn’t, but they were always going to have the power anyways. I feel like this is a compromise that would work for all users.</p>

<p>However, it’s important to judge the idea through data. Just as the introduction of seat belts actually increased road fatalities due to <a href="https://systemicfailure.wordpress.com/2015/02/26/mandatory-helmet-laws-are-like-mandatory-seatbelt-laws/" target="_blank">risk compensation</a>, there may be unintended side effects.</p>

<p><img src="/pictures/posts/bp11/seatbelt1.png" alt="" class="img-container-center" /></p>

<p>I proposed three metrics to measure success in my last article: user engagement, user posts, and user hesitation posts.</p>

<p>It’s important to measure user engagement because what’s the point of improving your platform if people stop using it? My prediction is that total user posts should go up in time because there should be less societal pressure, but you never know until you make the change. Finally, user hesitation posts are something that I believe will be important to measure in the first few months after the change and less important afterwards. To borrow from the last post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any time a user drafted a post and paused qualifies as a user hesitation post. Facebook should (and probably does) be able to monitor when someone hesitates before posting. Any person who hesitated has a decision tree that I’ve diagrammed below.
<img src="/pictures/posts/bp9/tree.jpg" alt="" class="img-container-center" />
<em><center>An example decision tree </center></em></p>

  <p>Assuming that more posts from personal users is better for the platform, Facebook would want to increase the conversion rate from hesitation to actual posts. However, this will be mostly a short-term metric to measure (perhaps the first few months). After that, people will have adapted their behavior and the change will have less of an impact on hesitation posts.</p>
