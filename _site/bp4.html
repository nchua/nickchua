        <h2>The Death of a Blog</h2>
        <p><span style="font-size: 10px">May 18th, 2019</span></p>

<p>This piece was inspired by a16z’s podcast <em>Innovating in Bets</em> with poker player Annie Duke. In the podcast she describes how in poker it is incredibly important to be a process-oriented thinker, rather than an outcome-based one. This helps players remain objective when analyzing their play and avoid being clouded by emotional feedback.</p>

<p>Throughout the podcast, Annie offers various methods for listeners to apply this process-oriented thinking in their own lives. I particularly liked the method which she called ‘time travel’. In order to time travel you need to do two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Project your project/dream/goal/blog five years into the future and imagine you’ve achieved everything you wanted. After projecting, take an inventory of the factors that led to your success. What did you do that made the most difference? Who did you meet that helped you most on your goal? Where did you get lucky? There’s an infinite number of scenarios, but try to boil down your thinking to the few most critical pieces. Annie didn’t say this explicitly, but I believe it’s also important to dream a little. Lots of things can change in five years, and what looks most out of reach might become realistic in the future.</li>
  <li>Create a pre-mortem of the same project/dream/goal/etc. Five years in the future, your ambitions regarding the project all catastrophically failed. Why? Was something you deemed to be mission-critical really just a distraction? What were the biggest reasons for failure? Together, this creates a post-mortem before it happens - hence a pre-mortem.</li>
</ol>

<p>To be honest, I could keep this brainstorming to myself. But I believe putting down thoughts into words distills the essence of the thought - if one cannot explain it in words then the thought is probably not fleshed out. Also, I believe in the power of public accountability. By putting these words online for the world to see it serves as a standard through which to judge me. For these reasons I will walk through the exercise below.</p>

<p>This post will serve as the pre-mortem for my blog. Why start with the negative? Annie talked about how people gladly engage in the first part, but often skip the second because it’s unpleasant to think about. To avoid the risk of avoiding the second part after I’ve written the first, it makes sense to start with the negative.</p>

<p>I’ve done my best to separate outcome failure from process failure, but I think it’s important to write about both. Ultimately we can see the outcome, but only I can influence the process. Process drives outcomes, so I start with the outcome and work backwards to explain the <em>why</em>.</p>

<center><h1>Made in Failure's Image</h1></center>

<p>To have a failure in outcome you must first have goals to fail at. I have three main goals for my blog: drive dialogue on issues I am interested in, meet and learn from influencers and thought leaders in those respective categories, and become a better writer.</p>

<p>Failure to achieve these goals would look like the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I was unable to drive any meaningful dialogue through my newsletters and blog posts. Either the quality of both were too low, or I wrote about topics interesting only to me.</li>
  <li>The thought leaders in categories that interested me either never saw my work, or deemed it too irrelevant/low quality to engage with me. This could potentailly be worse than never starting the blog at all - they now actively look down on my ideas and thoughts</li>
  <li>I stop writing, or the quality of my writing decreases over time. Since practice almost unequivocally makes one better, I find the second outcome relatively impossible without the first.</li>
</ol>

<center><h1>Habits of Failure</h1></center>

<p>The problem with habits is the best ones don’t show their value until later in the future, but the worst ones are generally rewarded immediately. The constant war between instant gratification and long-term benefit will be the most important inflection point for my blog.</p>

<p><strong>Habit One</strong> - <em>not showing up to the game</em></p>

<p>You miss every shot you don’t take, practice makes the master - there are many time old adages saying the same thing. You have to show up in order to play. Writing at it’s best looks natural and effortless, but it isn’t always easy and can be very frustrating.</p>

<p>Failing to write because of frustration will be the kiss of death for my blog. David Perell, one of my favorite writers online, wrote that the only way to get better at writing is simply by writing more. By avoiding writing, I have killed my blog in two ways with one habit. I will not have much content to share, thus the total addressable market (TAM) for my blog will be narrow. Furthermore, what little I <em>do</em> write will be of lower quality.</p>

<p>This affects all three parts of the failure outcomes. There cannot be dialogue without something to talk about, thought leaders favor interacting with higher quality material, and failure to practice will result in failure to improve.</p>

<p><strong>Habit Two</strong> - <em>perfection paralysis</em></p>

<p>becoming paralyzed by the fear of being mocked or being wrong - and you don’t get lucky by someone discovering my work</p>
