Peter Thiel's Zero to One is a must-read for founders and aspiring entrepreneur's. He emphasizes that there isn't a repeatable formula for success, but it does require a specific frame of thinking to create the future. 

In the book, there are two types of progress: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal progress is known as globalization - taking something and distributing it everywhere. Vertical progress is far more difficult becuase it is creating something that has never been done before. To Peter Thiel, vertical progress is moving from Zero to One.
