Peter Thiel's Zero to One is a must-read for founders and aspiring entrepreneurs. There is no one recipe for success, but Pether Thiel writes about the specific frame of mind an entrepreneur needs to be in in order to build the future. 

The book revolves around two types of progress: horizontal and vertical. We see horizontal progress everyday. It's basically globalization - taking something and distributing it everywhere. Vertical progress is rarer and more difficult to achieve because it involves creating something that has never been done before. Peter Thiel calls vertical progress Zero to One. 

What I found particularly useful and enjoyable about the book is Peter Thiel's use of stories to accentuate his message. Advice is always useful, but seeing how it played out in PayPal or other companies across the world helped me understand how it played out in reality. This advice was wide ranging - avoid competition, execute on a unique secret, and what questions need to be answered before creating an enduring business. 

Below I've written out my full notes from the book. It highlights what I think were the key points and quotations from every chapter. I've written these notes in a way that would help me 're read' the book without actually doing so, and I hope it's useful to you as well.

#### Chapter 1: The Challenge of the Future

Peter Thiels’s favorite interview question: What important truth do very few people agree with you on? 

A good answer takes the following form: Most people believe in x, but the truth is the opposite of x. 

Zero to One: The Future of progress 

There are two types of progress: horizontal/extensive progress or vertical/intensive progress

1. Horizontal progress is easy to imagine because we already know what it looks like
2. Vertical progress is difficult because it means doing something nobody else has ever done. 

Horizontal progress is the same thing as globalization - taking something that works and making it everywhere. Vertical progress involves taking something from Zero to One, and Peter Thiel calls that _technology_.

#### Chapter 2: Party like it’s 1999

The dot-com burst in 2000 taught investors four things (incorrectly):
1. Make incremental advances
2. Stay lean and flexible
