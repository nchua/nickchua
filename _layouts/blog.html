        <h2>My Blog </h2>
        <p>This is meant to be a weekly blog where I discuss articles I've read, podcasts I've listened to, or write down general thoughts. I am most interested in evolutions in technology, e-sports, and the VC/PE world. I will also occasionally write about other topics that occupy my attention, like the upcoming Avenger movie or Star Wars series. I can shamelessly admit that I am not as knowledgeable as any partner at a VC fund or even most bloggers, thus my writings will be mostly reactionary. Feedback and criticism are more than welcome, and you can reach me<!--&nbsp;--><a href="mailto:nick@nickchua.me" target="_blank"> here.</p>

          Take a guess on what is the most valuable form of entertainment. Is it the music industry? What about the movie industry, since Endgame has broken all the records? Or maybe it's television, since it seems everyone and their mother is talking about Game of Thrones... The simple answer is no, and it's not even close. I explore the largest form of entertainment, and it is only driving marketing dollars now.

          Part 2 of the series details my thoughts on the digital native generation and how it has been and will be absolutely essential for the growth of esports in the future.

        <p>
          I've wanted to write about esports for a while, but felt like I needed to write a position paper from which my future articles will be based off of.

        <h2><a href="bp3">Apple as a Portfolio Company</a></h2>
        <p style="font-size: 10px">April 7th, 2019 </p>
        <p>
          Apple has recently announced a bevy of new services, and it reminds me of a private equity pivot. This is my take on how Apple's new strategy could provide the innovation that they recently have lacked.

          Freddie Mercury is gone, the new Star Wars universe is in shambles, and the Back to the Future hoverboards are four years late. But for one reason, I can't die yet...

          What separates Tesla from other traditional car companies? Do they have enough of a competitive advantage to separate themselves from Waymo and Cruise? This blog draws inspiration from Ben Evans' <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/8/29/tesla-software-and-disruption"><i>Tesla, software and disruption</i></a> and explores why I believe there is an impending oligopolisitic revolution in the transportation industry.
