        <h2>My Blog </h2>
        <p>This is meant to be a weekly blog where I discuss articles I've read, podcasts I've listened to, or write down general thoughts. I am most interested in evolutions in technology, e-sports, and the VC/PE world. I will also occasionally write about other topics that occupy my attention, like the upcoming Avenger movie or Star Wars series. I can shamelessly admit that I am not as knowledgeable as any partner at a VC fund or even most bloggers, thus my writings will be mostly reactionary. Feedback and criticism are more than welcome, and you can reach me<!--&nbsp;--><a href="mailto:nick@nickchua.me" target="_blank"> here.</p>

        <h2><a href="bp3">Apple as a Portfolio Company</a></h2>
        <p style="font-size: 10px">April 7th, 2019 </p>
        <p>

        <p>
          Freddie Mercury is gone, the new Star Wars universe is in shambles, and the Back to the Future hoverboards are four years late. But for one reason, I can't die yet...

        <h2><a href="bp1">Tesla and the Future of Locomotion</a></h2>
        <p style="font-size: 10px">March 24th, 2019 </p>

          What separates Tesla from other traditional car companies? Do they have enough of a competitive advantage to separate themselves from Waymo and Cruise? This blog draws inspiration from Ben Evans' <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/8/29/tesla-software-and-disruption"><i>Tesla, software and disruption</i></a> and explores why I believe there is an impending oligopolisitic revolution in the transportation industry.
