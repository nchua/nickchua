        <h2>Reading List</h2>
        <p>
          Reading to me is a window into other worlds. This section will house my current favorite articles, books, podcasts, or newsletters I've read. Yes, I know podcasts don't count as reading, but I think they serve much of the same purpose as reading. These will not encompass all the articles and things I am reading, as the list might be tedious to scroll through. I will send out the full weekly list in my newsletters. Personal reading such as science fiction/fantasy books will be listed on the about me portion of my website.

        <h3>Books</h3>
        <p>
          I'm currently reading Different: Escaping the Competitive Herd by Youngme Moon. I've only gotten 30 pages through so far, but it's amazing. It's really opening my mind on how thinking 'the right way' is just making me like everyone else. Can't wait to finish the book.
