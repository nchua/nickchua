            My coursework at the college focused primarily on price discrimination and modeling firm and consumer behavior. Outside of class I was a member of the Trott Business Program and an executive member of the Order of the C, a student-athlete organization that acted as an intermediary between the athletes and administration. I was a Stagg Medal awardee and the captain of the Varsity Men's Tennis Team.
