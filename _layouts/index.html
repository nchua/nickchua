        <h2>My Blog </h2>
        <p>This is meant to be a weekly blog where I discuss articles I've read, podcasts I've listened to, or write down general thoughts. I am most interested in evolutions in technology, e-sports, and the VC/PE world. I will also occasionally write about other topics that occupy my attention, like the upcoming Avenger movie or Star Wars series. I can shamelessly admit that I am not as knowledgeable as any partner at a VC fund or even most bloggers, thus my writings will be mostly reactionary. Feedback and criticism are more than welcome, and you can reach me<a href="mailto:nick@nickchua.me" target="_blank"> here.</p>

      <h2><a href="bp8">How to Fight Climate Change</a></h2>
      <p>
        My submission for the <a href="https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/06/26/our-essay-competition-for-young-people">Economist Open Future</a> competition. I claim that technology is the key to making progress, starting with the regulation of climate deniers. I examine previous examples of public pressure causing political and economic change, and use them as a template for future change.

        Those of you who know me know that I love ramen. So when I got a chance to go to Japan for a week, I had to check out some of the best spots. This is my review and ranking of the places I tried in Japan.

        I examine why Pro View is a sign that Esports is finally ready to move beyond the status quo, why streaming the NBA should upset you, and what the future of streaming could look like.

      <p>
        From social media to SaaS companies powering the modern workplace, Venture Capital and the Valley have build the platforms that have changed the world. It's time for VCs to take a serious look into esports as an investment. I write about how the market fits Scott Kupor's power-law curve, the total addressable market, and potential ways to invest.

          Sex sells, we all know that. Video games is about as unsexy as it gets. But it keeps growing at an accelerated rate. The fourth part of my position paper series attempts to predict the future of esports by breaking it down into six core components.

        <p>
          Take a guess on what is the most valuable form of entertainment. Is it the music industry? What about the movie industry, since Endgame has broken all the records? Or maybe it's television, since it seems everyone and their mother is talking about Game of Thrones... The simple answer is no, and it's not even close. I explore the largest form of entertainment, and why it is only driving marketing dollars now.

          Apple has recently announced a bevy of new services, and it reminds me of a private equity pivot. This is my take on how Apple's new strategy could provide the innovation that they recently have lacked.

        <h2><a href="bp1">Tesla and the Future of Locomotion</a></h2>
        <p>
          What separates Tesla from other traditional car companies? Do they have enough of a competitive advantage to separate themselves from Waymo and Cruise? This blog draws inspiration from Ben Evans' <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/8/29/tesla-software-and-disruption" target="_blank"><i>Tesla, software and disruption</i></a> and explores why I believe there is an impending oligopolisitic revolution in the transportation industry.
